# AS
Scripts for AS analysis

**00. Run vast-tools and edgeR**

**01. Import vast-tools and edgeR outputs in R**

**02. Processing of vast-tools and edgeR tables**
- Extract gene expression profiles from RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors (Uniprot)
- Count and extract different types of AS events
- Melt dataframes for plots

**03. Plots**
- Plot heatmap with correlation of B cell reprogramming stages
- Plot types of AS events (area plot, barplot and heatmap)

**04. Clustering**
- Mfuzz (Kumar et al., 2007) clustering of differentially spliced cassette exons
- Correlation of gene expression profiles of genes containing the exons to each AS cluster
